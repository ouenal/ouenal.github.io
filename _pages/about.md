<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am currently working as a computer vision and machine learning researcher at Huawei Technologies, Zurich. Before joining Huawei, I receieved my PhD from ETH Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Luc Van Gool. During my PhD, I explored various topics under data-efficient LiDAR semantic segmentation, including and not limited to weakly-, semi-supervised semantic segmentation, multi-modal, multi-task training and active learning. After joining the TRACE-Zurich project, my focus shifted towards the interaction of 3D vision with natural language, working more specifically on dense 3D visual grounding. Before starting my PhD, I received a BSc and MSc from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at ETH Zurich.
